# Regression-Analysis
Regression Analysis
1. Data Acquisition
- Find a publicly available dataset from sources like UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other platform that utilizes regression tasks (e.g., predicting house prices, sales forecasting, etc.).
- Explain your choice of the dataset and how it is suitable for regression analysis.

2. Data Cleaning
- Load the dataset into your environment (e.g., Python with Pandas).
- Identify and handle missing values. Discuss your approach (removal, imputation, etc.).
- Identify and remove any duplicate entries, if present.
- Correct any data type inconsistencies (e.g., ensuring numerical types are recognized correctly).
- Provide a summary of your data after cleaning it (e.g., using the `.describe()` function).

3. Feature Engineering
- Create at least three new features that could potentially improve the model performance. Explain the rationale behind the creation of each feature.
- Consider interactions or transformations (e.g., polynomial features, logarithmic transformations, or categorical feature encoding).

4. Data Visualization
- Create at least five visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. Ensure they help in understanding the dataset:
  - Distribution of the target variable.
  - Correlation matrix heatmap.
  - Scatter plots showing relationships between features and the target variable.
  - Box plots to identify outliers.
- Provide interpretations of each visualization.

5. Regression Modeling
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70/30 split).
- Implement at least 5 regression models:
- For each model, perform the following:
  - Train the model on the training set.
  - Use appropriate hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search or Random Search).
  - Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, RÂ², etc.
  - Compare the results of each model and discuss which model performed the best and why.

6. Report
- Ensure your notebook is well documented including:
  - An introduction to the problem and dataset.
  - Details of your data cleaning process.
  - Descriptions of engineered features.
  - Visualizations with interpretations.
  - A summary of the regression models used, results obtained, and insights drawn.
- Your report should be well-structured, with clear headings and explanations.
